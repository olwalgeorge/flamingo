## üîß Usage Instructions

### Running the Seeding Script

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the seeding script
npm run seed

# Verify the setup
npm run verify
```

### Expected Output

The seeding script will:

1. Connect to MongoDB
2. Clear existing organization, admin, and contact data
3. Create new records
4. Display success messages with login credentials

### Verification Output

The verification script provides:

- Database connection status
- Organization details
- Admin user information
- Contact information summary
- Database statistics
- Next steps for getting started

## üîê Security Considerations

### Password Security

- Default admin password: `SecureAdmin@2025`
- **Important**: Change the default password immediately after first login
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12

### Account Security Features

- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Password reset token support
- Two-factor authentication support (disabled by default)
- Audit logging for admin actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modifying Organization Data

Edit the `organizationData` object in `scripts/seedDatabase.ts`:

```typescript
const organizationData = {
  name: "Your Organization Name",
  shortName: "Your CBO",
  description: "Your organization description",
  // ... other fields
};
```

### Modifying Admin User

Edit the `adminData` object in `scripts/seedDatabase.ts`:

```typescript
const adminData = {
  firstName: "Your",
  lastName: "Name",
  email: "your-email@domain.com",
  username: "yourusername",
  password: "YourSecurePassword",
  // ... other fields
};
```

### Adding More Contacts

Add entries to the `contactsData` array in `scripts/seedDatabase.ts`:

```typescript
const contactsData = [
  // ... existing contacts
  {
    department: "new-department",
    name: "Contact Name",
    title: "Contact Title",
    // ... other fields
  },
];
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Error**

   - Verify MongoDB connection string in `.env.local`
   - Ensure special characters in passwords are properly encoded
   - Check internet connection and MongoDB Atlas settings

2. **Permission Errors**

   - Ensure the MongoDB user has read/write permissions
   - Check database name in connection string

3. **Duplicate Data Errors**
   - The script automatically removes existing data before inserting
   - If errors persist, manually clear the collections

### MongoDB Index Warnings

The warning messages about duplicate indexes are harmless and occur due to Mongoose's automatic index creation. They don't affect functionality.

## üîÑ Re-running Scripts

### Resetting Data

To completely reset the database:

```bash
npm run seed:reset
```

This will:

- Remove all existing organization, admin, and contact data
- Create fresh records with the default data
- Preserve member and event data

### Backup Considerations

Before running seeding scripts in production:

1. Create a database backup
2. Test scripts in a development environment
3. Review all data being inserted
4. Update default passwords and sensitive information
