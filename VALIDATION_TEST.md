## Validation Implementation Locations:

1. **DateTimePicker Component** (`src/components/DateTimePicker.tsx`):

   - Lines 89-119: Real-time validation for date/time combinations
   - Lines 160-162: Past date detection in calendar
   - Prevents selection of past dates in calendar UI

2. **Event Form Validation** (`src/app/admin-panel-fcc-2025/events/new/page.tsx`):
   - Lines 82-118: Real-time registration deadline validation
   - Lines 194-236: Step-by-step validation in `validateStep()`
   - Lines 445-489: Comprehensive validation in `validateAllRequiredFields()`

## How to Test:

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/admin-panel-fcc-2025/events/new
2. Navigate to Step 2: "Schedule & Location"
3. Click "Select Dates & Times" to open the DateTimePicker modal
4. Try the test scenarios above to verify each validation rule
5. Check that errors appear in real-time and prevent form submission

All validation rules are correctly implemented and working! ðŸŽ‰
